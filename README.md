# Elevator control
Language: Java
This program simulates the control of a vertical passenger elevator (lift). The simulation is supposed to react to inputs made by a user
-   The lift does not have a door control
-   The lift waits at least 3 seconds when it reaches a destination floor
-   The number of floors must be queried when the program is started.One number for the lowest and one for the highest floor is requested. You can also enter negative numbers.  The maximum floor number is 12, the minimum -3.
-   The travel time between two consecutive floors is always 1 second
-   The elevator outputs each time it reaches a certain floor as destination ("X. Floor: Get off
-   please") or drives past it ("X. floor‚Äù)
-   When the lift has reached a certain floor as end position, the user can make requests for the next destinations
-   Several different destinations can be entered, up to a maximum of 4 destinations. No entries are counted for the current floor, these should not be accepted.
-   The completion of user input should be signalled by entering the number 99.
-   To simplify matters, your controller should only ensure that either the lowest or the highest desired floor is approached first. After that the destinations above or below are to be approached, at the end the highest or lowest entered destination is reached. To determine the direction, the elevator's position in relation to the requested destinations should be evaluated: depending on whether the top or bottom destination can be reached first, the elevator should first travel up or down and then, after reaching the top or bottom destination, travel to the destinations below or above.
-   Only when all targets have been processed, new requests should be accepted again.
